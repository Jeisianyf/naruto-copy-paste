            <h3> Naruto can be a bit difficult sometimes, you can not know this, but Naruto also grew up without a father. He has never actually met any of his parents, and has never had friends in our village. Yet I have never seen him cry, get angry or admit defeat, he is always willing to improve, he wants to be respected, it is his dream and Naruto would have given his life for it without hesitation. My guess is that he got tired of crying and decided to do something about it!
